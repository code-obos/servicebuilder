# Service Builder

In OBOS we decided to write our own microservice-chassis instead of using spring/j2ee/dropwizard. The reasoning was that
a microservice-chassis is just a bundling of microframeworks, a problem that is not to hard if you choose the right
microframeworks. We have found that this approach provides several advantages:
 * Fine grained control to tailor integration of microframeworks to our organizational-specific needs 
 * High degree of standardization in services
 * Room for innovation in code infrastructure
 
The code is tailored specific for our needs, it is dependent on our libraries and must be tailored to your needs.
  We wanted to share this code as an example/template of writing your own microservice-chassis.
